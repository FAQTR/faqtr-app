In order to rephrase a sentence, paragraph, essay or article effectively, content with good grammar and spelling is important when using this automatic paraphraser because it can only recognize, understand and rewrite correct grammar.
For an article rewriter that is in the form of a bot, it does a good job of respecting english and using replacements that make sense.
Content that is written in all caps or with the first letter of every word capitalized can still be rephrased by this software.
Otherwise, as long as the grammar of the content is sensible and recognizable, complex sentence generator can make the task of paraphrasing easy.
Rather than having to research synonyms for words or phrases and deduce which ones are the most suitable substitutes for any context a word or phrase may be used in, paraphrasing is done on auto pilot.
